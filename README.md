Task 1: Student Score Prediction, 
Dataset (Recommended): Student Performance Factors (Kaggle).

The script for this task performs a comprehensive analysis of student performance data using both linear and polynomial regression models.

Key observations:
Initial single-variable (Hours_Studied) analysis shows weak predictive power (R²=0.23), indicating other factors significantly influence exam scores.
The inclusion of additional features (Attendance, Previous_Scores, etc.) substantially improves model performance (R²=0.64), demonstrating the importance of multiple factors in predicting student performance.
Polynomial regression (degree 2) shows slight improvement over linear regression for the multi-variable model, but higher degrees (3-4) perform worse, suggesting potential overfitting.
The analysis effectively demonstrates feature importance through correlation heatmaps and model comparisons.
